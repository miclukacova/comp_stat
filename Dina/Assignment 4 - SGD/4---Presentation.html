###Introduction
Objective is to use stochastic optimization to estimate the parameters of a log-logistic dose-response model using non-linear least squares estimation. That is obtaining the parameters `\(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \rho\)` that minimize the loss function:
`$$L(X,(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\rho))=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\left( y_i - f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho)\right)^2$$`
&lt;br&gt;
Where the response is given by:
`$$Y_i = f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho) + \varepsilon_i \hskip5mm \text{with}\hskip2mm \varepsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0,\omega^2)$$`
And the log-logistic dose-response model is given by:
`$$f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho) = \gamma + \frac{\rho - \gamma}{1 + \exp(\beta \log(x_i) - \alpha)}$$`

---
###Stochastic Gradient Descent
Start out implementing a standard version of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGD). The gradient in a single point is given by
$$-2\cdot\nabla f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho)\cdot\left(y_i - f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho)\right)  $$

&lt;br&gt;
Where `\(\nabla f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho)\)` is given by
`$$\nabla f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho) = \begin{pmatrix}
  \frac{\rho-\gamma}{(1+\exp(\beta\log(x_i)-\alpha))^2}\cdot\exp(\beta\log(x_i)-\alpha)\\
  \frac{\rho-\gamma}{(1+\exp(\beta\log(x_i)-\alpha))^2}\cdot\exp(\beta\log(x_i)-\alpha)\cdot\log(x_i)\\
  1-\frac{1}{1+\exp(\beta\log(x_i)-\alpha)} \\
  \frac{1}{1+\exp(\beta\log(x_i)-\alpha)}
\end{pmatrix}$$`
So the update scheme becomes:
`$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t +2 \gamma_t\cdot\nabla f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho)\cdot\left(y_i - f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho)\right)$$`
Where `\(\theta_t = (\alpha_t, \beta_t, \gamma_t, \rho_t)\)` and `\(\gamma_t\)` is the learning rate at time `\(t\)`.
---
###Implementation
The gradient function and `\(f\)` are implemented seperately

``` r
sgd &lt;- function(
    par0,
    N, # Sample size
    gamma, # Decay schedule or a fixed learning rate
    epoch = NULL,
    maxiter = 100, # Max epoch iterations
    sampler = sample, # How data is resampled. Default is a random permutation
    cb = NULL,
    ...) {
  
  if (is.function(gamma)) gamma &lt;- gamma(1:maxiter)
  gamma &lt;- rep_len(gamma, maxiter)
  
  par &lt;- par0
  
  for (n in 1:maxiter) {
    if (!is.null(cb)) cb$tracer()
    
    samp &lt;- sampler(N)
    
    if (is.null(epoch)){
       for (j in 1:N) {
         i &lt;- samp[j]
         par &lt;- par - gamma[n] * gradient(par, i, ...)
       }
    } else {
      par &lt;- epoch(par, samp, gamma[n], ...)
    }
  }
  par
}
```

---
###Testing
We implement two types of samplers to test our data on. One that samples the `\(x_i\)`'s from the grid `\(e, e^2, ..., e^{15}\)` and one that samples `\(\log(x)\)` from `\(\mathcal{N}(0, \omega^2)\)`. We then test the algorithm on both samplers for 3 different values of parameters and 2 different starting values. Maybe??? Maybe not???

``` r
source("SO_source.R")
#Remember to source the SO_source file
set.seed(17102024)
param1 &lt;- parameters(5,2,1,2)
param2 &lt;- parameters(4,3,6,1)
param3 &lt;- parameters(1,1,1,1)
#Simulations of data
sim_1 &lt;- sim(param1, 1000)
sim_2 &lt;- sim(param2, 1000)
sim_3 &lt;- sim(param3, 1000)
sim_grid_1 &lt;- sim(param1, 1000, grid = TRUE)
sim_grid_2 &lt;- sim(param2, 1000, grid = TRUE)
sim_grid_3 &lt;- sim(param3, 1000, grid = TRUE)

#Running the SGD algorithm
```
