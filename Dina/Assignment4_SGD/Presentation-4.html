###Introduction

Objective is to use stochastic optimization to estimate the parameters of a log-logistic dose-response model using non-linear least squares estimation. That is obtaining the parameters `\(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \rho\)` that minimize the loss function:
`$$L(X,(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\rho))=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\left( y_i - f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho)\right)^2$$`

Where the response is given by:
`$$Y_i = f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho) + \varepsilon_i \hskip5mm \text{with}\hskip2mm \varepsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0,\omega^2)$$`
And the log-logistic dose-response model is given by:
`$$f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho) = \gamma + \frac{\rho - \gamma}{1 + \exp(\beta \log(x_i) - \alpha)}$$`


---

### Sampling
We implement an S3 object of class `My_params` with a `simulate` method to simulate data from the log-logistic dose-response model.
 
 - 2 different types of sampling methods
 
  - `grid_sample`: samples `\(X\)` from a fixed grid of points `\((e, e^2,..., e^{15})\)`.
  
  - `gauss_sample`: samples `\(\log(X)\)` from `\(\mathcal{N}(0, \omega^2)\)`. Note `\(\omega\)` may not be too large.

- The method also allows for scaling the data, which is useful for optimization.
 


``` r
simulate(parameters(2,1,2,1), 1000, omega = 1, grid = FALSE, scale = FALSE)
```

True parameters have been set to `c(2,5,1,2)` and the data is simulated with `N = 5000`.



---
###Preliminary Investigation
To get an idea of what the log-logistic dose-response model looks like, we plot the data and the model with the true parameters.

&lt;img src="Presentation-4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
###Preliminary Analysis
Plotting the `\(f\)`-function, where the different parameters are varied:
&lt;img src="Presentation-4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
### Stochastic Gradient Descent

Start out implementing a standard version of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGD). The gradient in a single point is given by
$$-2\cdot\nabla f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho)\cdot\left(y_i - f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho)\right)  $$

&lt;br&gt;
Where `\(\nabla f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho)\)` is given by
`$$\nabla f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho) = \begin{pmatrix}
  \frac{\rho-\gamma}{(1+\exp(\beta\log(x_i)-\alpha))^2}\cdot\exp(\beta\log(x_i)-\alpha)\\
  \frac{\rho-\gamma}{(1+\exp(\beta\log(x_i)-\alpha))^2}\cdot\exp(\beta\log(x_i)-\alpha)\cdot\log(x_i)\\
  1-\frac{1}{1+\exp(\beta\log(x_i)-\alpha)} \\
  \frac{1}{1+\exp(\beta\log(x_i)-\alpha)}
\end{pmatrix}$$`
So the update scheme becomes:
`$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t +2 \gamma_t\cdot\nabla f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho)\cdot\left(y_i - f(x_i| \alpha, \beta,\gamma,\rho)\right)$$`
Where `\(\theta_t = (\alpha_t, \beta_t, \gamma_t, \rho_t)\)` and `\(\gamma_t\)` is the learning rate at iteration `\(t\)`.

---

###Implementation

We implement the gradient and check that it is approximately `\(0\)` in the true parameters:





``` r
gradient(param$par, x, y)
```

```
## [1] -0.0009073312  0.0003959194 -0.0060345141 -0.0105528416
```

We then implement the SGD-algoritm.


``` r
sgd &lt;- function(par0, x, y, grad, epoch = vanilla,
    gamma, # Decay schedule or a fixed learning rate
    maxiter = 100, # Max epoch iterations
    sampler = sample, # How data is resampled. Default is a random permutation
    cb = NULL, ...) {
  
  if (is.function(gamma)) gamma &lt;- gamma(1:maxiter)
  gamma &lt;- rep_len(gamma, maxiter)
  
  N &lt;- length(x)
  par &lt;- par0
  
  for (n in 1:maxiter) {
    
    if (!is.null(cb)) cb$tracer()
    samp &lt;- sampler(N)
    par &lt;- epoch(par = par, samp = samp, gamma = gamma[n], 
                 grad = grad, x = x, y = y, ...)
  }
  return(par)
}

vanilla &lt;- function(par, samp, gamma, grad, x, y, ...){
  N &lt;- length(x)
  for (j in 1:N) {
    i &lt;- samp[j]
    par &lt;- par - gamma * grad(par, x = x[i], y = y[i], ...)
  }
  return(par)
}
```

---
###Implementation



 - Implemented a tracer using `CSwR`:

``` r
SGD_tracer &lt;- tracer(c("par", "n"), Delta = 0) 
```
 
 - S3 object `SGD`
 
  - Contains optimal parameters and trace. Stopping criteria is set to `\(e^{-6}\)` and is given by `\(||\theta'-\theta||^2\leq\varepsilon||\theta||^2+\varepsilon\)`, where `\(\theta\)` is the parameter vector.
  
  - Plot, print and summary methods are implemented to ease comparisons and analysis.



``` r
SGD(par0 = param$par, grad = gradient, gamma = 0.01, x = x, y = y, true_par = param$par)
```

```
## Optimal parameters:
## [1] 1.918253 4.847181 1.068926 2.018176
## Number of iterations:
## [1] 100
## Total time:
## [1] 15.95024
```

---

### Test of Algorithm 

We visualize the convergence for three different starting values `c(2, 5, 1, 2)`, `c(1, 1, 1, 1)` and `c(2.33, 1.09, 2.7, 2.32)`. The random starting values are used later as `init_par`.

### Decay Schedule

We implement a three-parameter power law family of decay schedules

$$
\gamma_n = \frac{\gamma_0 K}{K + n^{a}}
$$
We implement two ways of specification.
- Specify `\(a\)`, `\(K\)` and `\(\gamma_0\)`.
- Specify `\(a\)`, `\(n_1\)`, `\(\gamma_1\)` and `\(\gamma_0\)` to obtain specific `\(\gamma_n\)` at iteration `\(n_1\)`, which we have set to `\(150\)`.

We try the two decay schedulers. We set `\(\gamma_0 = 1\)` for them all and then try one variation of `\(K\)` and two variations of `\(a\)`. The starting paramters are the random starting parameters `init_par`. Based on this we will use the decayscheduler with `\(a = 1\)` and `\(\gamma_1 = 0.01\)`

###Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent
The idea is to calculate the gradient in a _batch_ of data points and update the parameters:

+ Sample `\(m\)` indices, `\(I_n = \{i_1, ...,i_m \}\)` from `\(\{1, ..., N\}\)`.
+ Compute `\(\rho_n = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i \in I_n} \nabla L_\theta(x_i, y_i, \theta_n)\)`
+ Update `\(\theta_{n+1} = \theta_n - \gamma_n \rho_n\)`

We sample a partition of `\(I_1 \cup I_2 \cup ... \cup I_{M} \subseteq \{1, ..., N\}\)` for `\(M = \lfloor N/m \rfloor\)`.

batch &lt;- function(par, samp, gamma, grad, x, y, m = 50, ...){
  M &lt;- floor(length(samp) / m) 
  for (j in 0:(M - 1)) {
    i &lt;- samp[(j * m + 1):(j * m + m)]
    par &lt;- par - gamma * grad(par, x = x[i], y = y[i], ...)
  }
  return(par)
}
```

###Momentum
Version of batch gradient descent where we add _momentum_ to the gradient through a convex combination of the current gradient and the previous gradient. Given `\(\theta_n\)` and a batch `\(I_n\)` with `\(|I_n| = m\)` we

 - Compute `\(g_n = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i \in I_n} \nabla_\theta L(y_i, x_i, \theta_n)\)`
 -  Compute `\(\rho_n = \beta \rho_{n-1} + (1 - \beta) g_n\)`
 - Update `\(\theta_{n+1} = \theta_n - \gamma_n \rho_n\)`

`\(\beta\)` determines the gradient memory. Default is set to `\(0.9\)`. Note that `\(\beta = 0\)` corresponds is just batch SGD.


``` r
momentum &lt;- function() {
  rho &lt;- 0
  function(par, samp, gamma, grad, x, y, m = 50, beta = 0.9, ...  ){
    M &lt;- floor(length(samp) / m) 
    for (j in 0:(M - 1)) {
      i &lt;- samp[(j * m + 1):(j * m + m)]
      rho &lt;&lt;- beta * rho + (1 - beta) * grad(par = par, x = x[i], y = y[i], ...)
      par &lt;- par - gamma * rho
    }
    par
  } 
}
```

###Adaptive learning rates
To mitigate tuning issues, we introduce adam algorithm, an adaptive learning rate algorithm. The idea is to combine momemtum with a standardiziation of each coordinate direction of the descent direction. This is in practice done by dividing the learning rate by a running average of magnitude of previous gradients:
`$$v_n = \beta_2 v_{n-1} + (1 - \beta_2) g_n \odot g_n$$`
where we denote `\(\beta_2\)` the forgetting factor. The complete algorithm is as follows:

 - Initialize `\(\theta_0\)`, `\(\rho_0 = 0\)`, `\(v_0 = 0\)`
 - Compute `\(g_n = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i \in I_n} \nabla_\theta L(y_i, x_i, \theta_n)\)`
 - Compute `\(\rho_n = \beta_1 \rho_{n-1} + (1 - \beta_1) g_n\)`
 - Compute `\(v_n = \beta_2 v_{n-1} + (1 - \beta_2) g_n \odot g_n\)`
 - Update `\(\theta_{n+1} = \theta_n - \gamma_n \frac{\rho_n}{\sqrt{v_n} + \epsilon}\)`

where we add `\(\epsilon\)` to avoid division by zero (default is `\(\epsilon = 10^{-8}\)`). The interpretation of `\(\beta_1\)` is the same as in the momentum algorithm.

###Batchsize

We have then looked at the convergence for the different versions of SGD, for different batch-sizes.

###Different decay schedules

Now looking at the convergence for the three different types of decay schedulers. The "illegal" one with `\(a=2\)` actually seems to be good for momentum and minibatch.

###Gradient Descent
We implement a standard gradient descent algorithm in an S3 object similar to that of the SGD.

 - Convergence criterion is `\(||\nabla\theta_n||_2^2 \leq \epsilon = 10^{-9}\)`. 
 - Backtracking line search to find step length. 
 - Also implemented momentum to optimize on speed and avoid getting caught in local minima.
 - Furthermore implemented gradient clipping - scaling the gradient by a `\(||\nabla f||^2\)` if it exceeds a certain threshold.
  

``` r
GD(x, y, par0 = init_par, grad = gradient_rcpp, H = H_rcpp, gamma0 = 1, 
     epsilon = 1e-9, maxiter = 5000, beta = 0.9, momentum = TRUE, clipping = TRUE)
```

```
## Optimal parameters:
## [1] 1.933854 4.865535 1.006982 2.011121
## Number of data points:
## [1] 5000
## Initial stepsize:
## [1] 1
## Number of iterations:
## [1] 4943
## Total time:
## [1] 7.425255
## Momentum:
## [1] TRUE
## Gradient Clipping:
## [1] TRUE
```

---
###Gradient Descent
We choose the optimal stepsize using crossvalidation. We sample a small grid `\((0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4)\)` of step sizes and choose the one that minimizes the loss function. Here it is minimized in 4.


Convergence of the standard implementation, with momentum and with momentum and gradient clipping.

###Further Possible Optimization

####Exploiting a grid-structure
Assuming we only sample the `\(x\)`-values from fixed grid, we could possibly optimize our implementations further.

 - However, even when the x's are sampled from a grid, we have and added noise variable on our `\(Y\)`-values.
 
 - This could possibly be mitigated by a form of binning. I.e binning all the `\(Y\)`'s associated to a specific `\(X\)`-value and then taking the mean of the `\(Y\)`'s in the bin.
 
 - I have not pursued the implementation of it. But it could be a possible extension to the project.
 
####Full Rcpp-implementation
One coul possibly make the implementation even faster, by implementing the entire algorithm in Rcpp.
